 ===
 
 ## Description
 
Simple "get started" react assignment. Use [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to get up and running.
 
Create a small editor that allows user to set properties 
and those changes are reflected in the display:

You should aim to add 5-10 different settings the user can change.
 
For this assignment:
 
* You can stick with a single `App` component
* Initialize state using `this.state = {}` in the constructor (don't forget to call `super(props)`
* Write JSX in the `render` method of the `App` component
  * Use `this.state.prop` to access state values
  * Use `e => { this.someMethod(e.target.value) }` (or whatever you need from the event object) to call
  a method you create on the component that in turn calls `this.setState({ prop: newValue })` to update the value
  
## Rubric
  
* Works *2.5pts*
* Curiousity/Going Beyond What we did in class *5pts*
* Clean-up stuff you didn't use from `create-react-app` default *2.5pts*
